## Projects-Portfolio

## My name is Abegail McCalla, a STEM graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Electronics and Computer Science (Honours, UWI) and an Occupational Associate Degree in Renewable Energy Technology (Valedictorian, UCC Academy). My background spans computing, electronics, renewable energy, and full‑stack web development, with hands‑on experience as a Photovoltaic Technician at Conserve It Limited installing solar panels, designing layouts, and managing project data, as well as engineering multiple web applications including a CRM system, a date‑matching platform, and a Course Management System supporting 100,000+ students. I bring strong technical execution from roles in IT support and lab demonstration, sharpening my problem‑solving, communication, and collaboration skills, while also leading projects that integrated IoT automation, database systems, API integration, JWT authentication, and responsive dashboards. With academic training in circuit analysis, AutoCAD, and project management, combined with proficiency in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, HTML/CSS, Flask, PHP, and MySQL, I merge technical precision with user‑focused design to deliver scalable, data‑driven solutions. My discipline, adaptability, and proven ability to work independently while maintaining clear communication across teams make me well‑aligned to contribute to solar project development as well as to creating high‑quality, intuitive user experiences in software and robotics engineering.
